### Description
The `settings.json` represents the settings I use for the [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal). The `aliases.bat` file is run by the `cmd.exe` on start as set up in terminal's settings.

Please note that the `ubuntu-icon.png` is a favicon of [Ubuntu system page](https://ubuntu.com/). Therefore it is not licensed under MIT as the rest of files in this repository and I do not claim rights to this image.
